# Summary
This project is designed to provide a seamless user experience for an e-commerce platform. It includes user authentication via Google, managing user sessions, handling various product-related operations (selling, ordering, searching, filtering), and managing user profiles and cart functionalities. The backend is built with Express and Node.js, with MongoDB as the primary database and Redis for session management. Firestore is used for image storage. Razorpay is integrated for payment processing, and the application supports a map feature on the frontend to display sellers' locations.
